eError: m_a should contain only integers or floats

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[{"a": 1}, 8.8]]))
    
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    
    TypeError: m_b should contain only integers or floats

Finally, the length of all rows in matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` should be

equivalent. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
